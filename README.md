# Personal Expense Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes personal finance data and provides insights into spending habits. The goal is to visualize your spending patterns and track changes over time.

### Key Features:

- **Spending by Category**: Visualizes the distribution of spending across different categories (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment).
- **Total Spending Over Time**: Shows trends in total spending on a monthly basis.
- **Data Visualizations**: Generates a pie chart and a line graph for easy analysis.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taylor-DeVries/financial-data-exploration
cd financial-data-exploration
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Instal Dependencies

Install the required libraries using requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Analysis

Run the script to analyze your expense data:

```bash
python expense_analysis.py
```

This will generate two PNG images:

- spending_by_category.png: A pie chart showing the distribution of expenses by category.

- total_spending_over_time.png: A line graph showing the total spending over time (monthly).

You can find these images in the project folder after running the script.

### Visualizations
